# Microsoft Excel Analysis of Delivery_dataset

This project analyses a delivery dataset containing warehouse location, order date, delivery date, customer ID, and zip code with Microsoft Excel.

## Answered Questions
The following are the questions I set out to answer:
- Find the total number of orders for each zip code per month.
- What percentage of customers return after the first order within a week, within a month, within 3 months, 6 months, and year?
- What percentage of customers never came back? Is it correlated with the delivery time? 
- How fast do orders get delivered by zip code? Overall and each month?
- From what warehouse does each zip code have the most deliveries? 
- How fast does each zip code grow with the number of orders? Are there any declines?
- Is there a season factor?
- From which warehouse orders get deliveredÂ faster?
